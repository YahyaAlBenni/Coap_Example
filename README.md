This project simulates an IoT-based sensor data controller designed to handle and forward periodic sensor readings to a server using the CoAP protocol. The controller generates random sensor data at regular intervals (every 30 seconds), mimicking real-world sensor inputs. The data is logged locally and sent to a predefined server endpoint for processing. Additionally, the controller hosts a CoAP server, allowing clients to retrieve the latest sensor data via GET requests. This implementation demonstrates a lightweight and efficient approach to sensor data management in IoT systems.
